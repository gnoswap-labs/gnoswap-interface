**Pull Request Title**
Your pull request title must follow the conventional commits format and start with one of the following types:
- **feat:** A new feature.
   - Use this type when you introduce a new feature to the codebase or enhance existing functionality.
   - Example: **feat: Add user authentication**
- **chore:** Routine tasks or maintenance.
   - Use this type when you perform tasks that don't directly change the codebase, such as updating dependencies, configuration changes, or setting up build processes.
   - Example: **chore: Update dependencies**
- **fix:** A bug fix.
   - Use this type when you fix a bug or an issue in the existing codebase.
   - Example: **fix: Resolve memory leak issue**
- **test:** Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests.
   - Use this type when you add new tests to improve code coverage or fix existing tests that were incorrect or failing.
   - Example: **test: Add unit tests for user registration**
- **style:** Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code.
   - Use this type when you make changes that only affect the code's appearance, such as whitespace, indentation, or formatting adjustments.
   - Example: **style: Apply gofmt to the codebase**
- **refactor:** Refactoring code that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
   - Use this type when you restructure existing code to improve its readability, performance, or maintainability without changing its functionality.
   - Example: **refactor: Optimize database query logic**
