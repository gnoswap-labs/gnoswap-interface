# Gnoswap Interface 
Welcome to the open source interface for Gnoswap, the first decentralized exchange (DEX) powered by Gnoland, designed to simplify concentrated liquidity experience and increase capital efficiency for traders.

_Note: Gnoswap is in active development and not yet in production, and we welcome your contributions! Please check our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/gnoswap-labs/gnoswap-interface#contributing--support) and the [latest release](https://github.com/gnoswap-labs/gnoswap-interface/releases) to see the current development status._

## Project Overview
This repository hosts the codebase for the Gnoswap interface, which enables users to interact with Gnoswap. The interface is built using TypeScript and is designed to be user-friendly, secure, and accessible, despite having complex mechanisms such as concentrated liquidity and staking as part of its core service.

## Development Setup
The Node.js version is 18.14.2.  
We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

```bash
# If you don't have that version installed,
# $ nvm install

$ nvm use
```

We use [yarn berry](https://yarnpkg.com) to manage our packages.  
And we use the [yarn workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/features/workspaces).

```bash
# If you don't have a yarn berry

$ npm i yarn -g
$ yarn set version berry
```
